        <p>
            With greater adoption of digital services over traditional physical
            delivery methods, there is an increasing need to ensure that they
            are of optimal quality. In this spirit, the
            <a href="/">Singapore Government Design System (SGDS)</a> aims to
            empower agencies to create fast, accessible, and mobile-friendly
            digital services with a common set of UI components, patterns, and
            templates.
        </p>
        <p>
            Where applicable, SGDS complies with the
            <a
                href="/guidelines/standards-and-best-practices/digital-service-standards.html"
                target="_blank"
                >Digital Service Standards (DSS)</a
            >, which is a set of policies, standards, and guidelines to help
            agencies implement digital services that meet the goal of delivering
            digital services that are easy-to-use, seamless, and relevant, as
            set out in the

        SGDS consists:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Components:</strong> A collection of open-source,
                front-end components that you can reuse or customise to build
                websites quickly while not compromising on specific needs. All
                components have been checked to ensure they adhere to
                accessibility standards.

                colours according to your needs. It also features a built-in
                colour contrast checker to help with accessibility checks;
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Patterns</strong> for common use cases rather than
                having to build them on your own. All patterns have been checked
                to ensure they adhere to accessibility standards; and
            </li>

        <h2 id="how-do-you-use-sgds">How Do You Use SGDS?</h2>
        There are three main use cases for SGDS:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Static Informational Websites</strong> are basic and
                    easy to build. They only provide client-side content in the
                    form of HTML pages (alternatively, CSS or JavaScript), and
                    do not require server-side processing. To launch such
                    websites, agencies can make use of the SGDS CSS/JavaScript
                    with template package and incorporate it into any
                    open-source static site generator like
                    <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>.
                    Alternatively, agencies can also use the SGDS package as a
                    base to start building their websites.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Dynamic Informational Websites</strong> also provide
                    client-side content. However, unlike Static Informational
                    Websites, Dynamic Informational Websites generate such
                    content using a server and database. To launch such
                    websites, agencies can use the SGDS WordPress or Sitefinity
                    package to develop locally.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Transactional Websites are</strong> the most complex
                    among the three. They support transactions such as online
                    banking and retail purchasing. Agencies are able to use SGDS
                    to start building or choose which components they require
                    for their websites.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

            The

                >SingapoRediscover Vouchers</a

            website and the
            <a href="/" target="_blank"
                >Singapore Government Developer Portal</a
            >
            teams made use of SGDS when launching their websites. The teams were
            able to use SGDSâ€™ ready-made components and framework, rather than
            starting from scratch, which saved them valuable time.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 id="whats-next">What's Next</h2>
        <p>
            The SGDS team plans to improve the offerings to include frameworks
            such as React, Vue, and Angular.
        </p>
        Feature enhancements are also in the works to add more customisability
        to the components, such as:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Feature to customise number of pages and items to display when
                using the pagination component; and
            </li>
            <li>
                Feature for notifications to be manually dismissed or timed to
                disappear after a defined duration when using the notification
                component.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            On top of feature enhancements, the team will be creating additional
            patterns and templates.
