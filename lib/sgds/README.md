## Installation

### CSS

```html
<head>
    ...
    <link
        rel="stylesheet"
        href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@govtechsg/sgds/css/sgds.css"
    />
    ...
</head>
```

### Vanilla JavaScript

SGDS components makes use of [bootstrap v5.1.3 js library](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/javascript/) as an external dependency. If you only need the visual parts of SGDS, or if you are [using frontend frameworks like React](https://react.designsystem.tech.gov.sg), you do not need to import this.

> `@govtechsg/sgds` uses `bootstrap-icons` for certain components like Form but it is not ship with it. Install `bootstrap-icons` or use CDN if you need it. Please refer to [bootstrap-icons](bootstrap-icons) for usage instructions.
