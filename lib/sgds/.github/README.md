# Purpose of `.github` Directory

This directory exists to address an issue encountered when running `npm version` command within a sub-directory.

## Purpose

The `.github` directory is specifically created to resolve an issue where running the `npm version` command in a sub-directory leads to failure in generating Git tags. This occurs because the command assumes the presence of the `.github` directory and `package.json` file in the same directory, resulting in the inability to create tags.

## Issue Explanation

The issue arises due to the assumption made by `npm version` command about the project's structure. When executed within a sub-directory, it doesn't correctly locate the `.github` directory and `package.json`, leading to the failure in creating Git tags.
