## Installation
### CSS

```html
<head>
    ...
    <link
        rel="stylesheet"
        href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@govtechsg/sgds/css/sgds.css"
    />
    ...
</head>
```

### Vanilla JavaScript

SGDS components makes use of [bootstrap v5.1.3 js library](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/javascript/) as an external dependency. If you only need the visual parts of SGDS, or if you are [using frontend frameworks like React](https://react.designsystem.tech.gov.sg), you do not need to import this.


>`@govtechsg/sgds` uses `bootstrap-icons` for certain components like Form but it is not ship with it. Install `bootstrap-icons` or use CDN if you need it. Please refer to [bootstrap-icons](bootstrap-icons) for usage instructions.

```html
<head>
  ...
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@govtechsg/sgds/css/sgds.css" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-icons@1.9.1/font/bootstrap-icons.css">
  ...
</head>

<body>
  ...
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"
    crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
</body>
```

For more information, please refer to the [components documentation](https://www.designsystem.tech.gov.sg/components).

### Via NPM

$ npm i @govtechsg/sgds bootstrap-icons
```

```js
//importing css
import "@govtechsg/sgds/css/sgds.css";

import '@popperjs/core';

***
## Frontend frameworks

Usage with frameworks such as React, Vue or Angular is discouraged since they manipulate the DOM in their own environments. Framework-specific implementations are in early development and can be found at [sgds-react](https://github.com/GovTechSG/sgds-govtech-react)
