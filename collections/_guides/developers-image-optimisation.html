<p>
  Think of image optimisation as both an art and a science - there is no
  definitive answer to how you can best compress an image. Fortunately,
  there are many well-developed tools out there that can help you to
  significantly reduce the size of your images.
</p>
<p>Here are some tips for you to get started:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Use vector formats:</b> Vector images are resolution and scale-independent,
    providing high-resolution images across multiple devices.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Pick the best raster image format:</b> Determine functional requirements
    and select the one that suits each particular asset.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Experiment with optimal quality settings for raster formats:</b> Start
    with the lower quality settings, the results are often good and
    byte savings are significant.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Serve scaled images:</b> Resize images on the server, and ensure that
    the display size is as close as possible to the natural size of the image.
  </li>
</ul>
