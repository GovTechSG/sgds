<h3>Implementing accessible design</h3>
<p>
  There are many ways for you and your agency to achieve accessibility,
  without impacting the overall look and feel of your digital services.
</p>
<div class="sgds-accordion-container">
  <div class="sgds-accordion">
    <a class="sgds-accordion-header">
      Provide sufficient contrast between foreground and background
      <i class="sgds-icon sgds-icon-chevron-down"></i>
    </a>
    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        Foreground text needs to have sufficient contrast with background
        colors. This includes text on images, background gradients, buttons, and
        other elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        This does not apply for logos, or incidental text, such as text that
        happens to be in a photograph. Minimum contrast ratio (level AA) should
        be 4.5:1 and enhanced contrast ratio (level AAA) should be at least 7:1.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="sgds-accordion">
    <a class="sgds-accordion-header">
      Do not use color alone to convey information
      <i class="sgds-icon sgds-icon-chevron-down"></i>
    </a>
    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        While color can be useful to convey information, color should not be the
        only way information is conveyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should consider using other additional identification
        to differentiate your design elements,
        e.g. use an asterisk(*) to indicate required form fields,
        use labels to distinguish areas on your graphs.
      </p>
    </div>

  <div class="sgds-accordion">
    <a class="sgds-accordion-header">
      Ensure that interactive elements are easy to identify

    </a>
    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create distinctive styles for your design elements,
              e.g. links and buttons, so they are more identifiable.</li>
            <li>Ensure that styles and naming for interactive elements are consistent
              throughout the website.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>

  <div class="sgds-accordion">
    <a class="sgds-accordion-header">
      Provide clear and consistent navigation options

    </a>
    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure that navigation across pages in your website has a
              consistent design - naming, styling and positioning.</li>
            <li>Provide more than 1 method of website navigation,
              e.g. site search or site map.</li>
            <li>Helps users to understand their positions in a website by providing
              orientation cues, e.g. breadcrumbs and clear headings.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="sgds-accordion">
    <a class="sgds-accordion-header">
      Ensure that form elements include clearly associated labels

    </a>
    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        Ensure that all fields have a descriptive label adjacent to the field.
        For left-to-right languages, labels are usually positioned to the left
        or above the field, except for checkboxes and radio buttons where they
        are usually to the right.
      </p>
      <p>
        Avoid having too much space between labels and fields.

        Provide feedback for interactions, such as confirming form submission,
        alerting the user when something goes wrong, or notifying the user of
        changes on the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instructions should be easy to identify. Important
        feedback that requires user action should be presented in a prominent
        style.
      </p>

  <div class="sgds-accordion">
    <a class="sgds-accordion-header">

      <p>
        <ul>

              content more apparent.</li>
            <li>Style headings to group content, reduce clutter, and make it
              easier to scan and understand.</li>

            <li>Position and presentation of main elements,
              e.g. headers and navigation, should be modified to make
              the best use of the space.</li>
            <li>Text size and line width should be set to maximize readability
              and legibility.</li>
            <li>A display in a wide window, with small text, should use
              multiple columns for primary content, visible navigation options,
              and visible secondary information.</li>
            <li>A display in a narrow window, such as a mobile phone, or
              with large text should use a single column for primary content.
              Navigation options and secondary information should be revealed
              using an icon.</li>

      <p>
        Provide a place in your design for media alternatives.
        <br />
        For example, you might need:

      <ul>
        <li>Visible links to transcripts of audio</li>
        <li>Visible links to audio described versions of videos</li>

    </a>
    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        Provide visible controls to allow users to stop any animations or
        auto-playing sound. This applies to carousels, image sliders, background
        sound, and videos.
