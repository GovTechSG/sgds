<h3>Implementing accessible design</h3>
<p>
  There are many ways for you and your agency to achieve accessibility,
  without impacting the overall look and feel of your digital services.
</p>
<div class="sgds-accordion-container">
  <div class="sgds-accordion">
    <a class="sgds-accordion-header">
      Provide sufficient contrast between foreground and background
      <i class="sgds-icon sgds-icon-chevron-down"></i>
    </a>
    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        Foreground text needs to have sufficient contrast with background
        colors. This includes text on images, background gradients, buttons, and
        other elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        This does not apply for logos, or incidental text, such as text that
        happens to be in a photograph. Minimum contrast ratio (level AA) should
        be 4.5:1 and enhanced contrast ratio (level AAA) should be at least 7:1.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="sgds-accordion">
    <a class="sgds-accordion-header">
      Do not use color alone to convey information
      <i class="sgds-icon sgds-icon-chevron-down"></i>
    </a>
    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        While color can be useful to convey information, color should not be the
        only way information is conveyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should consider using other additional identification
        to differentiate your design elements,
        e.g. use an asterisk(*) to indicate required form fields,
        use labels to distinguish areas on your graphs.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="sgds-accordion">
    <a class="sgds-accordion-header">
      Ensure that interactive elements are easy to identify

    </a>
    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create distinctive styles for your design elements,
              e.g. links and buttons, so they are more identifiable.</li>
            <li>Ensure that styles and naming for interactive elements are consistent
              throughout the website.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="sgds-accordion">
    <a class="sgds-accordion-header">
      Provide clear and consistent navigation options

    </a>
    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure that navigation across pages in your website has a
              consistent design - naming, styling and positioning.</li>
            <li>Provide more than 1 method of website navigation,
              e.g. site search or site map.</li>
            <li>Helps users to understand their positions in a website by providing
              orientation cues, e.g. breadcrumbs and clear headings.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="sgds-accordion">
    <a class="sgds-accordion-header">
      Ensure that form elements include clearly associated labels
      <i class="sgds-icon sgds-icon-chevron-down"></i>
    </a>
    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        Ensure that all fields have a descriptive label adjacent to the field.
        For left-to-right languages, labels are usually positioned to the left
        or above the field, except for checkboxes and radio buttons where they
        are usually to the right.
      </p>
      <p>
        Avoid having too much space between labels and fields.
      </p>
    </div>

        Provide feedback for interactions, such as confirming form submission,
        alerting the user when something goes wrong, or notifying the user of
        changes on the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instructions should be easy to identify. Important
        feedback that requires user action should be presented in a prominent
        style.
      </p>

  <div class="sgds-accordion">
    <a class="sgds-accordion-header">

      <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use whitespace and proximity to make relationships between
              content more apparent.</li>
            <li>Style headings to group content, reduce clutter, and make it
              easier to scan and understand.</li>

            <li>Presentation of page information varies based on display
              viewports, e.g. mobile phones or zoomed browser windows.</li>
            <li>Position and presentation of main elements,
              e.g. headers and navigation, should be modified to make
              the best use of the space.</li>
            <li>Text size and line width should be set to maximize readability
              and legibility.</li>
            <li>A display in a wide window, with small text, should use
              multiple columns for primary content, visible navigation options,
              and visible secondary information.</li>
            <li>A display in a narrow window, such as a mobile phone, or
              with large text should use a single column for primary content.
              Navigation options and secondary information should be revealed
              using an icon.</li>

    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        Provide a place in your design for media alternatives.
        <br />
        For example, you might need:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visible links to transcripts of audio</li>
        <li>Visible links to audio described versions of videos</li>

  <div class="sgds-accordion">
    <a class="sgds-accordion-header">
      Provide controls for content that starts automatically

    </a>
    <div class="sgds-accordion-body">
      <p>
        Provide visible controls to allow users to stop any animations or
        auto-playing sound. This applies to carousels, image sliders, background
        sound, and videos.
