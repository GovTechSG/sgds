    Adopting the SGDS incrementally
  </h3>
</header>


<p>
  SGDS helps the government design and build better online experiences for the public. As a toolkit to design and build government websites, the SGDS provides:
</p>

<header>
  <h4>
    Framework
  </h4>
</header>

<p>
  A framework that works right out of the box with most of the configuration already done 
</p>

<header>
  <h4>
    Code
  </h4>
</header>

<p>
  Our code provides an accessible, mobile-friendly experience across government sites. Youâ€™ll be able to copy and paste code snippets or <a href="">import only dependencies</a> that you need.
</p>
<header>
  <h4>
    Design assets
  </h4>
</header>

<p>
  By providing the SGDS in Sketch and Figma, we allow designers to hit the ground running by having everything that they need already setup
</p>

<header>
  <h4>
    Guidelines for components
  </h4>
</header>

<p>
  We provide guidelines for user experience for our components and patterns work as intended
</p>

<header>
  <h4>
    Guides
  </h4>
</header>

<p>
  Guides for best practices are provided for designers, developers and writers to help them get started with their digital products 
</p>

<p>
  With all these in place, even before using the framework or adding any of the SGDS code, you can start using SGDS by adopting our UX guidelines for the components (e.g guidelines for our <a href="">text field</a>). When you are ready, you can start incorporating the SGDS code incrementally by <a href="">customising with Sass</a> so you can pull only the components that you need.
</p>

<p>
  The SGDS is build to be flexible and you can add on components or customise styles if you so wish to and adapt it to the product or digital service you are creating
