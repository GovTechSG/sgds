    <p>To complement the visual style, we highly recommend going through the Digital Service Standards (DSS), to ensure
      that you adhere to the policies/clauses stated. Even though our components are built and designed with the clauses
      in place where applicable, there are instances where they can't be designed or coded.</p>
