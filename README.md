# Singapore Government Design System

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@govtechsg/sgds.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@govtechsg/sgds)

[SGDS](https://www.designsystem.gov.sg) is a frontend framework that aims to provide a beautiful common visual language and user experience for visitors of Singapore Government websites. It provides designers and developers with customisable components to help them easily implement the Singapore Government's [Digital Service Standards](https://www.tech.gov.sg/digital-service-standards/).

## Installation

### Browsers

#### CSS

```html
<head>
    ...
    <link
        rel="stylesheet"
        href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@govtechsg/sgds@{{site.version}}/css/sgds.css"
    />
    ...
</head>
```

#### JavaScript

[Certain components](#javascript-components) of SGDS makes use of `sgds.js`, with jQuery as an external dependency. If you only need the visual parts of SGDS, or if you are [using frontend frameworks like React](#frontend-frameworks), you do not need to import this.

```html
<body>
    ...
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@govtechsg/sgds@{{site.version}}/js/sgds.js"></script>
    ...
</body>
```

##### JavaScript components

- Mandatory
    - Main Nav
    - Side Nav
- General
    - Accordions
    - Dropdowns
    - Tabs

For more information, please refer to the [documentation](https://www.designsystem.gov.sg/docs).

### NPM

```sh
$ npm i @govtechsg/sgds
```

#### Webpack

```javascript
import "@govtechsg/sgds/css/sgds.css";
import "@govtechsg/sgds/js/sgds"; // Do not use with other web frameworks*
```

##### Frontend frameworks

Usage with frameworks such as React, Vue or Angular is discouraged since they manipulate the DOM in their own environments. Framework-specific implementations are in early development and can be found at [sgds-govtech-react](https://github.com/govtechsg/sgds-govtech-react) and [sgds-govtech-vue](https://github.com/govtechsg/sgds-govtech-vue).

## Usage

See [docs](https://www.designsystem.gov.sg).

## Development

### Requirements

-   Ruby & Bundler. Install Jekyll and dependencies through `bundle install`
-   Nodejs & NPM. Install webpack and dependencies through `npm install`

To spin up a live-reloading Jekyll + Webpack development server it is recommended that you use **two separate terminal sessions** so that you can kill any of them easily:

```bash
# Terminal 1
$ npm run dev:static
```

``` bash
# Terminal 2
$ npm run dev:jekyll # Access from localhost:4000
```
