<h2 class="has-text-primary is-size-3">Third Party Materials</h2>
<ul>
    <li class="margin--bottom">
        <p>
            The Service may require, enable or facilitate access to or use of software or services
            of a third party (“Third Party”). In such an event, there will be terms of use of the
            third party software or service (the “Third Party Terms”) that will bind either GovTech
            or you or both. An example of Third Party Terms may be open source software terms or
            standard form terms of the distribution platform from which you obtain any part of the
            Service (e.g. Google Play Store or Apple App Store terms) which bind GovTech as a
            developer or user of the distribution platform (the “Distribution Terms”). Information
            on the Third Party Terms are embedded in the Service, publicly available (e.g the
            Distribution Terms) or otherwise listed in the Schedule herein. For the avoidance of
            doubt, insofar as this Clause 4 relates to the Distribution Terms, the relevant
            Distribution Terms are the terms of the specific platform from which you obtained a copy
            of the software or application that is part of the Service. For example, if you obtained
            the said copy from the Google Play Store, then the relevant terms are Google’s
            Distribution Terms.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li class="margin--bottom">
        <p>
            You are deemed to have notice of the Third Party Terms. In particular, you are deemed to
            have notice of any terms that GovTech (under the Third Party Terms) is required to
            notify you, and you unconditionally agree to be bound by all the obligations in the
            Third Party Terms which are applicable to you as the end user.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li class="margin--bottom">
        <p>
            If the Third Party Terms require you to enter into an agreement directly with the Third
            Party, then you unconditionally agree to enter into such agreement, and in any event, to
            be legally bound by the Third Party Terms.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li class="margin--bottom">
        <p>
            If the Third Party Terms expressly or impliedly require GovTech to incorporate certain
            terms in these Terms of Use (inclusive of terms which impose any minimum or maximum
            standards herein, and/or terms described in Clause 4.5 below), such terms are deemed to
            have been so incorporated (the “Incorporated Terms”). Examples of Incorporated Terms
            include provisions which require GovTech to give you notice of certain rights and
            liabilities or require GovTech to ensure that you acknowledge certain matters.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li class="margin--bottom">
        <p>
            Some Third Party Terms grant the Third Party, or require GovTech to grant the Third
            Party, direct rights of enforcement of these Terms of Use as a third party beneficiary,
            against you. Such Third Party Terms are deemed to have been incorporated into these
            Terms of Use as Incorporated Terms, and you hereby agree to grant such Third Party, such
            direct rights of enforcement against you.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li class="margin--bottom">
        <p>
            You agree to indemnify and keep GovTech harmless against all claims, actions,
            liabilities, losses, damages, costs or expenses (including legal costs on an indemnity
            basis) howsoever arising out of or in connection with your access or use of the
            aforesaid third party software or services or your non-compliance with the Third Party
            Terms or Incorporated Terms which causes GovTech to breach any of the Third Party Terms.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li class="margin--bottom">
        <p>
            For the avoidance of doubt, without prejudice to Clause 4.4, to the extent of any
            inconsistency between these Terms of Use and the Third Party Terms, the latter shall
            prevail provided nothing in the Third Party Terms increases the liability of GovTech
            beyond that stated in Clause 6.
        </p>
    </li>
