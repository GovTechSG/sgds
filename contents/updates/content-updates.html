<h3>v2 Release Info:</h3>

    <li>
      <h5>v2 Portal with Bootstrap 5</h5>
      <p>
        We will be incorporating Bootstrap 5 as our base framework for our v2
        components. This will also be leveraged across upcoming projects.

      <h5>React Storybook Library</h5>
      <p>
        In addition to our v2 portal, we will also be releasing a React library
        version displayed in Storybook UI explorer to cater to more users.
        Upcoming projects such as Vue & Web Component will also be hosted in

      <h5>v1 Support to Continue</h5>
      <p>
        Do note that v1 usage will still be supported. However, we encourage
        users to transition to v2 as we are actively building on new features
        within the platform and having more user feedback will help us serve our
        users better.
