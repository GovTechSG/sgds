      <h5>v2 Portal with Bootstrap 5</h5>
      <p>
        We will be incorporating Bootstrap 5 as our base framework for v2
        components. This will also be leveraged in upcoming projects.

        In addition to our v2 portal, we will be releasing a React library
        version that will be rendered in Storybook UI explorer. Upcoming
        projects such as Vue & Web Component will also be hosted in Storybook.

      <h5>v1 Continued Support</h5>
      <p>
        Take note that v1 usage will still be supported. However, we do
        encourage users to transition to v2 as we are actively bringing out
        improvements to the platform and having more user feedback will only
        help us better serve our users.
