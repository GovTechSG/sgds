        <p>Image optimisation is both an art and a science as there is no definitive answer for how to best compress an image and there are many well-developed tools that can help reduce the size of an image significantly.</p>
        <p>Here are some tips for you to get started:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Prefer vector formats:</b> Vector images are resolution and scale independent, which makes them a perfect fit for multi-device and high-resolution world.</li>
            <li><b>Pick best raster image format:</b> Determine functional requirements and select the one that suits each particular asset.</li>
            <li><b>Experiment with optimal quality settings for raster formats:</b> Try with the lower quality settings, the results are often very good and byte savings are significant.</li>
            <li><b>Serve scaled images:</b> Resize images on the server and ensure that the display size is as close as possible to the natural size of an image.</li>
        </ul>
