<p>We constantly keep these core principles in mind when making design decision at Design System.</p>
<p><b>Clarity:</b> Easy to understand and navigate. Elements highlight important content and improve interactivity.</p>
<p><b>Efficiency:</b> Optimised workflow helps you to deliver the highest quality government websites to the public
    easily.</p>
<p><b>Consistency:</b> A consistent and unified government branding implements familiar standards and strengthens
    intuition by using standard text styles, icons and interface elements.</p>
<p><b>Reusable:</b> Eliminate the burden of recreating basic components and patterns for every new product. Components
    in Design System will be a comprehensive collection of tried-and-tested assets that reflect the industry best
    practices.</p>
